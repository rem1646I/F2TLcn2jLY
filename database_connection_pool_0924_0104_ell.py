"""
This module provides a database connection pool manager using Bottle framework.
It is designed to handle multiple database connections efficiently and manage them.

Attributes:
    connection_pool (list): A list to hold database connections.
    pool_size (int): The maximum number of connections in the pool.

Methods:
    create_pool(): Initializes the connection pool with the specified size.
    get_connection(): Returns a connection from the pool if available.
    release_connection(connection): Releases a connection back to the pool.
